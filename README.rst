Specification of Regions of Interest for scientific data analysis
=================================================================

This repository contains the specification in ReStructuredText format.
The current specification can be seen on the `SciJava website
<http://www.scijava.org/roi-model/>`_.

If you want to rebuild the specification from scratch, you need to install
sphinx, python, graphviz, texlive (on Debian-based systems, please call ``sudo
apt-get install sphinx-common python graphviz texlive``). Then simply run
``make``.
