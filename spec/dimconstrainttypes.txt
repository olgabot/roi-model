## nD constraints

# Constrain region to a single value within a specific dimension.
1	Value	nD	A value in an arbitrary dimension
# Constrain region to multiple values within a specific dimension.
2	Values	nD	A set of values in an arbitrary dimension
# Constrain region to a range of values within a specific dimension.
3	Range	nD	A range of values in an arbitrary dimension
# There are no limits in the additional dimension; these must be set
# by combining with a range instead.

## nD transformations and shape operations

10	ExtrudeDim	nD	Extrude a shape of arbitrary dimensionality into an additional dimension.
# The result is a shape combining all subset dimensions.
# It is illegal to have a common dimension between the two shapes.
11	DimConstraintSet	nD	Combine shapes of differing dimensionality
