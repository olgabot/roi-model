#ShapeID	Shape	Dims	Description

## 3D geometric forms with no intrinsic volume

0	Point	3D	A single point
1	Points	3D	A set of points
2	Line	3D	A single line
3	Lines	3D	A set of lines
4	Polyline	3D	A set of connected points (open)
5	Polygon	3D	A set of connected points (closed)
6	PolylineSpline	3D	A set of connected splines (open)
7	PolygonSpline	3D	A set of connected splines (closed)
8	Arc	3D	An arc

## 3D geometric forms with intrinsic volume

10	Cuboid	3D	A cuboid
11	Ellipsoid	3D	An ellipsoid
12	Cylinder	3D	An elliptic cylinder
13	Mesh	3D	A mesh

## 3D pixel data

# A bitmask may be aligned with the axes (with an aligned bounding
# box) or unaligned (with an unaligned bounding box).  In order to
# iterate over the mask with a 1:1 correspondence between mask and
# underlying image pixel data, it must be converted to an aligned
# form.  Additionally, it must be converted to an aligned form with
# the samples aligned with the pixel grid.

30	BitMask	3D	A mask with one bit values

# A greymask may be aligned with the axes (with an aligned bounding
# box) or unaligned (with an unaligned bounding box).  In order to
# iterate over the mask with a 1:1 correspondence between mask and
# underlying image pixel data, it must be converted to an aligned
# form.  Additionally, it must be converted to an aligned form with
# the samples aligned with the pixel grid.

31	GreyMask	3D	A mask with multiple grey levels

## 3D transformations and operations

40	AffineTransform	3D	Affine transformation of a shape
41	AbstractTransform	3D	Abstract (implementation-defined) transformation of a shape
42	Bitwise	3D	Binary bitwise operation

## Grouping

# All operations operate individually upon the contained shapes.  This
# implies that transforms are performed upon each shape, with rotation
# centres in the centre of each shape.
70	Set	3D	A set of shapes

## Annotations

# Text in 3D will need to be based upon a rectangle in 3D (not yet
# possible without a transform).  Should label alignment be specified
# directly in the representation, or in higher-level metadata?
100	Text	3D	Text (label)
101	Scale	3D	A scale bar between two points
# TODO: Specify grid spacing
102	Grid	3D	A scale grid in a defined volume

## Custom (user-definable) shapes

# The custom shape type, unlike other shapes, does not define any
# intrinsic behaviour.  This is entirely the responsibility of the
# user.  The typename of the shape is specified by the user, which
# provides an extension mechanism by allowing this type to be used to
# specify an arbitrary number of shape types.
#
# The shape contains four sets of shapes for measurement, results,
# editing and visualisation.  The intent here is that the shapes
# required for the user to visualise the ROI are contained in the
# VISUAL set.  This will permit the ROI to be transported to other
# systems, and allow visualisation without any knowledge of the
# specific ROI type.  The other types are optional, and may be used as
# the user sees fit.  MEASUREMENTS is intended to store any points or
# other informations used when defining the ROI (which are not already
# contained in the VISUAL set).  RESULTS is intended to store any
# measurements which are not directly derivable from the other sets.
# EDIT is intended for storing label offsets, construction lines, and
# any other information used for editing which is not contained in
# the MEASUREMENTS or VISUAL sets.

200	Custom	3D	A custom (user-definable) 3D shape

201	Property	nD	A custom (user-definable) shape property
