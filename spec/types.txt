### Shapes

#Shape	Description

## 3D geometric forms with no intrinsic volume

scijava.roi.shape.Point	A single point
scijava.roi.shape.Points	A set of points

scijava.roi.shape.Cuboid	A cuboid
scijava.roi.shape.Ellipsoid	An ellipsoid
scijava.roi.shape.Cylinder	An elliptic cylinder
scijava.roi.shape.Mesh	A mesh

## 3D pixel data

# A bitmask may be aligned with the axes (with an aligned bounding
# box) or unaligned (with an unaligned bounding box).  In order to
# iterate over the mask with a 1:1 correspondence between mask and
# underlying image pixel data, it must be converted to an aligned
# form.  Additionally, it must be converted to an aligned form with
# the samples aligned with the pixel grid.

scijava.roi.shape.BitMask	A mask with one bit values

# A greymask may be aligned with the axes (with an aligned bounding
# box) or unaligned (with an unaligned bounding box).  In order to
# iterate over the mask with a 1:1 correspondence between mask and
# underlying image pixel data, it must be converted to an aligned
# form.  Additionally, it must be converted to an aligned form with
# the samples aligned with the pixel grid.

scijava.roi.shape.GreyMask	A mask with multiple grey levels

## 3D transformations and operations

scijava.roi.shape.AffineTransform	Affine transformation of a shape
scijava.roi.shape.AbstractTransform	Abstract (implementation-defined) transformation of a shape
scijava.roi.shape.Bitwise	Binary bitwise operation

## Grouping

# All operations operate individually upon the contained shapes.  This
# implies that transforms are performed upon each shape, with rotation
# centres in the centre of each shape.
scijava.roi.shape.Set	A set of shapes

## Annotations

# Text in 3D will need to be based upon a rectangle in 3D (not yet
# possible without a transform).  Should label alignment be specified
# directly in the representation, or in higher-level metadata?
scijava.roi.shape.Text	Text (label)
scijava.roi.shape.Scale	A scale bar between two points
# TODO: Specify grid spacing
scijava.roi.shape.Grid	A scale grid in a defined volume

## Custom (user-definable) shapes

# The custom shape type, unlike other shapes, does not define any
# intrinsic behaviour.  This is entirely the responsibility of the
# user.  The typename of the shape is specified by the user, which
# provides an extension mechanism by allowing this type to be used to
# specify an arbitrary number of shape types.
#
# The shape contains four sets of shapes for measurement, results,
# editing and visualisation.  The intent here is that the shapes
# required for the user to visualise the ROI are contained in the
# VISUAL set.  This will permit the ROI to be transported to other
# systems, and allow visualisation without any knowledge of the
# specific ROI type.  The other types are optional, and may be used as
# the user sees fit.  MEASUREMENTS is intended to store any points or
# other informations used when defining the ROI (which are not already
# contained in the VISUAL set).  RESULTS is intended to store any
# measurements which are not directly derivable from the other sets.
# EDIT is intended for storing label offsets, construction lines, and
# any other information used for editing which is not contained in
# the MEASUREMENTS or VISUAL sets.

scijava.roi.shape.Custom	A custom (user-definable) 3D shape

scijava.roi.object.Property	A custom (user-definable) object property

### nD

# Constrain region to a single value within a specific dimension.
scijava.roi.dimconstraint.Value	A value in an arbitrary dimension
# Constrain region to multiple values within a specific dimension.
scijava.roi.dimconstraint.Values	A set of values in an arbitrary dimension
# Constrain region to a range of values within a specific dimension.
scijava.roi.dimconstraint.Range	A range of values in an arbitrary dimension
# There are no limits in the additional dimension; these must be set
# by combining with a range instead.

## nD transformations and shape operations

scijava.roi.dimconstraint.ExtrudeDim	Extrude a shape of arbitrary dimensionality into an additional dimension.
# The result is a shape combining all subset dimensions.
# It is illegal to have a common dimension between the two shapes.
scijava.roi.dimconstraint.DimConstraintSet	Combine shapes of differing dimensionality
